                        representation, warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all
                        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a

                        In no case shall CoinShare, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents,
                        contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss,
                        claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any
                        kind, including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data,
                        replacement costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including
                        negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any
                        products procured using the service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of
                        the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any
                        content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the service or any
                        content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if
                        advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                        the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or
                        jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
